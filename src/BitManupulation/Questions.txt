1. Count Set Bits:
Write a function to count the number of set bits (1s) in an integer.

2. Check if a Number is a Power of Two:
Write a function to determine whether a given integer is a power of two.

3. Swap Two Numbers:
Write a function to swap two numbers without using a temporary variable, using bitwise operators.

4. Find the Single Non-Repeating Element:
Given an array where every element appears twice except for one, find that single element.

5. Detect if Two Integers Have Opposite Signs:
Write a function that returns true if two given integers have opposite signs, and false otherwise.

6. Bitwise AND of Numbers Range:
Given two integers left and right, write a function to find the bitwise AND of all numbers in the range [left, right].

7. Reverse Bits:
Reverse the bits of an unsigned integer.

8. Count Different Bits in Two Numbers:
Write a function that counts the number of bits needed to convert integer A to integer B.

9. Generate Power Set:
Given a set of integers, generate its power set using bit manipulation.

10. Maximum XOR of Two Numbers in an Array:
Given an array of integers, find the maximum XOR value of any two elements.
